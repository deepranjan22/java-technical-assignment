# Notes

Please add here any notes, assumptions and design decisions that might help up understand your though process.

Basically I have implemented below two as the time permits in an hour:
Buy one, get one free
Buy one kilo of vegetables for half price

Also below two need to be implemeted :
Buy two items for Â£1 - currently its implemented as "Buy one, get one free", but need to be refactored with right implmentation
Buy three items for the price of two

I have assumed two types of  interfaces are required to implement Discount, one for priced per unit and one for priced per kilo.
